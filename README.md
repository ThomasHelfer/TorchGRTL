# TorchGRTL

## Overview
TorchGRTL (Torch General Relativity Toolkit) is a Python library that provides a PyTorch-based implementation of key components of [GRTL codebase](https://example.com](https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration/GRChombo)) . It leverages the power of PyTorch to accelerate computations, making it suitable for machine learning applications in physics and simulation.

## Features
- Efficient PyTorch-based computations for general relativity simulations.
- Integration with machine learning workflows.

## Installation
